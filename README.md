- End all forms of malnutrition by 2030
- Achieve internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5 years
- Address nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women, and older persons

### Target 2.3: Double Agricultural Productivity
- Double agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers
- Focus on women, indigenous peoples, family farmers, pastoralists and fishers
- Ensure secure and equal access to land, productive resources and inputs

### Target 2.4: Sustainable Food Production
- Ensure sustainable food production systems
- Implement resilient agricultural practices
- Increase productivity and production
- Help maintain ecosystems and adapt to climate change

### Target 2.5: Maintain Genetic Diversity
- Maintain genetic diversity of seeds, cultivated plants, and farmed animals
- Promote access to and fair sharing of benefits from genetic resources
- Support traditional knowledge and practices

## üìä Current Global Status

### The Challenge
- **828 million people** faced hunger in 2021
